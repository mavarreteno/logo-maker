# Logo-Maker

## Description

The Logo Generator App is a command-line application that allows users to create SVG logos with a selected shape ( in a chosen color) and optional text inside. The app provides an interactive interface using the inquirer library to collect user input for the shape, text, and color of the logo. All you have to do to enjoy the benifits of this great application is clone the repo to your local machine, open the root directory in your terminal, run 'npm i' and 'node index', and follow the promt in your terminal which will ask you about the specifics of your desired logo. Follow these steps and you are all set and done! You will have an svg file containing your very own automatically generated logo.
